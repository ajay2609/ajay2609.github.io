I am a radio astronomer interested in highly energetic events in the Universe. My research is particularly focused on 
Fast Radio Bursts, but I am also interested in searching for and understanding the nature of pulsars (a special kind of neutron star).
The origin of Fast Radio Bursts is still known but astronomers are working to unveil the mystery.
Thanks for all the help.
